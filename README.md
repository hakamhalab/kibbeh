# Illustration of cutting kibbeh method, using python

There are many ways to slice up a tray of kibbeh bil seeniyeh, one of my favourite Levantine dishes, which Aleppo is particularly famous for.
I chose one of the most common methods and wrote python code to illustrate it. I relied on python's turtle library.

# How can you contribute?
Until the kibbeh tray is cut into 8 slices, all seems neat. You are kindly invited to try to improve the accuracy going further, cutting it into diamonds.
